For use in uBlock Origin

### Facebook ###

Filters for blocking Suggested posts, Paid Partnership posts and miscellaneous items in Facebook.

Works with most languages. 

__Notes:__<br />
- Most of the rules do not use keywords to find the items, instead they look for a particular structure pattern.

### Sponsored posts ###

Due to FB using HTML's _shadow-root_ facility, it is not so easy to create generic rule for all users to use for detecting Sponsored posts. <br />
<br />
This [script](https://github.com/zbluebugz/facebook-clean-my-feeds/tree/main/uBO-sponsored-filter), will create a customised rule that most likely works with your computer setup.
